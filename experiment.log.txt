Experiment #1 Policy syncronize

N  1 n   24
    bcast       took 0.15 seconds
    network dir took 0.08 seconds

N  5 n  120
    bcast       took 0.20 seconds
    network dir took 0.15 seconds

N 50 n 1200
    bcast       took ?.?? seconds
    network dir took ?.?? seconds

Looks like bcast is faster when using large number of NODES
